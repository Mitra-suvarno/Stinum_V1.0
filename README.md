# Stinum_V1.0
Stinum is a project that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate text from user input. It is designed to be used as a chatbot, allowing users to interact with it in natural language.

The project is open source and available on GitHub. It can be used for free, but requires an OpenAI API key to access the GPT-3 API.

Stinum is designed to be easy to use and customize. It has a simple web interface that allows users to enter their input and view the generated output. The code can also be modified to customize the behavior of the chatbot or add additional features.
